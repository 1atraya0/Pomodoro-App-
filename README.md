# Pomodoro Timer with Face Detection

This is a web application that combines a Pomodoro timer with real-time face detection using OpenCV. The timer tracks the time a person is present in front of the webcam and pauses when they leave the frame. This project aims to enhance focus and productivity while also monitoring face presence.

## Features

- **Real-Time Video Feed**: Displays live video from the webcam.
- **Pomodoro Timer**: Counts elapsed time while the user is present.
- **Face Detection**: Pauses the timer when no face is detected and resumes it when a face re-enters the frame.
- **Flipping Clock Animation**: A visually appealing clock display that simulates a flipping effect.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python with Flask
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV for face detection
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Styling**: Custom CSS for a unique user interface with a watercolor background.
